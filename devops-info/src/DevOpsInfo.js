      <p>
        DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev)
        and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development
        life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.

      <p>
        DevOps emphasizes automation, collaboration, and integration between
        software developers and IT operations professionals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Key concepts of DevOps include continuous integration (CI),
        continuous delivery (CD), microservices, infrastructure as code (IaC),
